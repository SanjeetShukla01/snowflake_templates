 ## Common Pitfalls - 01:
 
Do not use trial account for POC. Trial accounts have no control and accountablity and you are putting your data on risk.
You may mitigate risk and limit your exposure by provisioning Sandpit accounts using Snowflake trial accounts found here: https://signup.snowflake.com/. The challenges of using free trial accounts are self-evident; there are no proper controls, or accountability, for usage and you put your organizationâ€™s reputation at risk
